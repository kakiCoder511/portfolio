                        <p>PlutoPay is a <strong>mobile financial app </strong>that helps users find a way to have a safe and efficient
                            way to do <strong>online shopping and money transactions </strong>everywhere, as well as<strong> finance management</strong>,
                            assisted with the latest technology.

                        <h2><strong>Why did I create this App?
                            </strong></h2>
                        <p>I want to create a <strong>straightforward financial app </strong> that assists people in
                            efficiently
                            managing their finances. I believe <strong>technology combined with the design
                                process</strong> can help people solve many financial
                            problems and saving their time.

                        <h3><strong>What do I get from Competitive Analysis?</strong></h3>
                        <p>The <strong>primary risk for our app</strong> is that some strong capital competitors seem to
                            provide a full range of financial services and a high standard of security support. For
                            example,
                            money transfers and online payment in secure ways, such as QR codes or virtual payment. This
                            could make it hard for us to stand out.

                            That said, through the competitive analysis, we <strong> get different features, ideas, and
                                financial solutions from competitors</strong>. The global coronavirus pandemic catalysed
                            the
                            commerce trend in 2020. So there’s still a chance to offer a more compelling product and
                            steal a
                            market share.</p>
                        <h3><strong>Insight from Survey finding</strong></h3>
                        <p>The survey was conducted with <strong>15 Participants</strong> and shared on CareerFoundry
                            slack’s channel and what’s app group.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Online shopping and money transfer</strong> to different people's accounts play a
                            significant part in the online transaction market. Over 20 % of responses take the
                            investment in
                            the attractive feature. We may explore the need for <strong>investment features</strong> in
                            the
                            notice.
                        </p>
                        <h3><strong>Insight from user intwerview</strong></h3>
                        <p><strong>The attractive and unique feature is essential </strong>to attract new customers, as
                            there are too many ways
                            to make payments online. However, users don’t want to catch it up because of the
                            fast-growing
                            technology. Besides, the <strong> Money transfer service </strong>is still an attractive
                            feature
                            in a finance app.
                            Notable that <strong>cryptocurrency is one of the key features </strong>that need to be
                            studied;
                            some users are
                            willing to invest in it, although it’s a high-risk investment.</p>

                        <p>This study aims <strong> to observe and measure the app’s learnability and
                                efficiency.</strong>
                            I have <strong>conducted usability testing with 6 participants.</strong> I enjoyed
                            the<strong> usability observations</strong> very much, where I could find many problems and then
                            improve the product prototyping model. For example, users would be frustrated about finding
                            the entry point, curious about the difference between the choices of saving targets, and
                            annoyed about the split course sequence. I am pleased with the result and learned much from
                            the users’ comments. After usability tests, <strong>you will discover how to turn
                                complicated into simple.</strong></p>

                <h2>Challenges </h2>
                <p>This was my first time designing a financial banking experience. Significantly, banking app services
                    are trending all over the world, but I had yet to try them before and never knew what the difference
                    is from traditional banking. <strong>The challenge I had during this process was to think about the smooth
                    user flow and creating unique features.</strong>What is the best way to give users a great and smooth
                    “Split-cost and Smart-saving” experience? Why do they get frustrated with financial services?</p>


                <p>I am  <strong>challenged by some parts of the design process, such as the format of the information
                    architecture and the content under each page</strong>. I spent much time on study and refining the sitemap.
                    Apart from the sitemap, I pay much   <strong>attention to the material design guidelines</strong>, which I have yet to
                    get used to following before.
                </p>
                <p>I overcame those questions and challenges was to asking my mentor and peers in the UX community for
                    their feedback, user tests, and research online.<strong>They gave me great insights and let me think about
                    the UX approach with empathy.</strong>
                </p>
                <h2>Takeaways</h2>
                <p>For the next time, I have to<strong> improve my technical skills in Figma</strong>. It is not easy to finish a project
                    without proficiency in the tool—for example, the application of the components and animated effects
                    in Figma to perform high-fidelity Prototyping.
                </p>
                <p> Besides that, I will pay more <strong>attention to web content accessibility</strong>, which is a curial part of the
                    end-to-end design. I will explore some Figma plugins, such as Stark, to improve the diversity
                    design.
