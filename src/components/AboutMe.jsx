          Hi, I’m Kaki

            A fullstack developer connecting the dots between storytelling, structure, and everyday life.

        <p>I didn’t start in tech. My first “code” was editing timelines in video productions. I spent over 10 years shaping messages through visuals in the corporate world.</p>

        <p>After studying UX design in a bootcamp, I wanted to go further — to build tools, not just shape how they look. That’s how I found fullstack development.</p>

        <p>Somewhere in between, I also became a London bus driver — a role that taught me patience, real-world problem-solving, and how small systems affect people's everyday journeys.</p>

        <p>Every dot — whether behind a camera, behind the wheel, or behind the code — has shaped how I think, listen, and build.</p>
